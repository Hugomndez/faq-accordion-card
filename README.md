setHeight(contentEl.scrollHeight);
```

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://dominicarrojado.com/posts/how-to-create-your-own-accordion-in-react-and-typescript-with-tests/) - This helped me on creating the accordion feature. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollHeight) - The Element.scrollHeight read-only property is a measurement of the height of an element's content, including content not visible on the screen due to overflow.
